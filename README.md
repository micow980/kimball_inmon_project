📊 Kimball vs Inmon: A Hands-On Comparison Using Star and Snowflake Schemas in PostgreSQL
A real-world experiment comparing the performance, structure, and usability of star vs. snowflake schema models using PostgreSQL and the same raw dataset.

📁 Project Overview
The way you model data can directly impact cloud costs, query speed, and developer experience. In this project, I take a single CSV dataset and build two data warehouses:

🟣 A Star Schema following the Kimball methodology (denormalized)

🔷 A Snowflake Schema following the Inmon methodology (normalized)

Each schema is then loaded into PostgreSQL and benchmarked using real SQL queries. This repo contains all the code, CSV outputs, and observations from that side-by-side analysis.

✅ Queries Used
Sample SQL query run against both schemas:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  a.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name,
  COUNT(fa.film_id) AS film_count
FROM fact_film_actor_*
JOIN dim_actor_* a ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
GROUP BY a.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
HAVING COUNT(fa.film_id) > 3
ORDER BY film_count DESC;
(Replace * with star or snowflake to run on each model)

📈 Key Findings
Metric	Star Schema	Snowflake Schema
Query Speed	⚡ Faster (1.8ms)	Slightly slower (2.8ms)
Schema Complexity	Lower	Higher
Storage Efficiency	Lower (duplicated values)	Higher (normalized values)
Usability	Easier to query	More flexible long-term

💡 Sometimes the simplest schema wins in speed, but the snowflake model pays off in maintainability and consistency at scale.

🧠 Lessons Learned
Data modeling isn't just academic — it has real performance and cost trade-offs.

PostgreSQL’s query planner can favor either schema depending on shape, size, and query intent.

Normalized tables help long-term governance; denormalized tables help fast querying and reporting.
